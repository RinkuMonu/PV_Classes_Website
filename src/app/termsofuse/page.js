         Return will not be accepted if the customer does not like the material or color of the dress. We suggest that the customer read the product description before ordering.
         <br />

Exchange is accepted if the customer wants to exchange the dress with a different dress of similar or higher value. (We do not give free shipping for exchanged dresses.The original product is sent by the customer at their own expense. If the customer pays shipping charges for exchanges, then we can arrange reverse pickup (₹80) and dispatch a new parcel (₹70). In total, ₹150 shipping charges must be paid by the customer.)

 <br />Return will not be accepted if the customer does not like the color of the dress. We try our best to ensure exact colors as shown. However, 5–10% variation is unavoidable due to lighting effects.<br />

Return will not be accepted if the customer is not satisfied, as we commit to deliver what we have displayed and for the prices we have charged which is the best possible.
